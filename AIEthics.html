	      <p style="text-indent:30px;" >The implementation of AI into usable or entertaining tools seems to have unlimited potential. It can be found in health devices, help find answers to simple questions on the internet, create logos and images, generate ideas, create memes, and a ton more. As AI is continuing to become more advanced and prevalent in ordinary citizens daily life, it is critical to acknowledge, address, and find a solution to AI’s ethical concerns. There is widespread concern about potential and already realized misuse and abuse of AI. This extends itself to “Deep Fake” technology and the general spreading of misinformation or disinformation through AI channels. Resolutions to these issues won’t come easy, however, acknowledging them and making everyday people aware of thesm will arm people with the knowledge needed to better navigate problematic situations created by AI. (see my 'Whatt is AI?' page for more information on how AI works)</p>
            
	    <p style="text-indent:30px;" > Deep Fake Technology</p>
	<p style="text-indent:30px;" > The exciting and innovative advent of AI has brought with it some very troublesome results. One of which being “Deep Fake” technology. Deep Fakes are primarily false AI generated videos of powerful/influential/famous people engaging in an activity or speaking about something while trying to be passed off as true. This has had harmful effects in the political sphere as nefarious individuals have used deepfakes to influence elections and garner favorability/unfavorability towards a specific political candidate. Tate Ryan-Mosley of MIT Technology Review gives insights to specific situations like these in his article “How generative AI is boosting the spread of disinformation and propaganda”. He reports that Venezuelan news sources have used deepfakes to create videos of American news anchors supporting Venezuelan government actions (Ryan-Mosley). Furthermore, he informs us that AI videos have been made about Joe Biden and Donald Trump, where Joe Biden made transphobic remarks and another video of Donald Trump embracing Anthony Fauci in a hug (Ryan-Mosley). </p> 
	<p style="text-indent:30px;" > Misinformation and Disinformation </p>
	<p style="text-indent:30px;" > Falsified images, videos, and audio through AI Deep Fakes segue us into the next related ethical concern with AI, that is Misinformation and Disinformation. Misinformation is the unintentional passing of untrue information while Disinformation is the intentional passing of untrue information. AI is known to “accidentally” proport untrue information or indiscriminately push forward political/social ideals without afterthought. Neuroscience & Behavioral scientist, Sophia Ricciardone, unravels this phenomenon as AI’s attempt at social mimicry, in her article “How AI bots spread misinformation online and undermine democratic politics”. She explains that the prevalence of AI bots on social media websites has contributed to heated political and social discourse. This has happened due to AI bot’s ability to accurately replicate the nature of human tweets, particularly when it comes to emotionally charged words, slogans, and general rhetoric (Ricciardone). This means AI has found a way to create its own tweets almost indistinguishable from human tweets and done it in such a way that breeds remarkable engagement by real users with its content; through prevalent and circulating emotionally charged language found on social media platforms. This can lend itself to spreading untrue or dubious ideals throughout the user base</p>
