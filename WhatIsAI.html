	      <p style="text-indent:30px;">To better understand the top ethical concerns surrounding AI it is best to know about what AI actually is and how it works. Cole Stryker and Eda Kavlakogu of IBM write an informative article detailing concepts in the computing world that predate the AI that we know today and how the AI of today works. Cole and Eda explain that, “A simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years [ago]” (Stryker & Kavlakogu). By this they mean there are four main concepts enveloped within each other (like a Russian nesting doll) that have allowed for AI as we know it to come into fruition.</p> 
         <p style="text-indent:30px;">The first concept starts in the 1950s with the broad idea of Artificial Intelligence, followed by Machine Learning in the 80’s, Deep Learning in the 2010’s, and finally the Generative AI of today.</p> 
         <p style="text-indent:30px;">Artificial Intelligence is just the broad term for the series and functions of a machine that emulate the thinking of human beings. Machine Learning is “training an algorithm to make decisions or predictions based on data” (Stryker & Kavlakogu). The algorithm itself is modeled after human beings’ brains.  This is accompanied by a host of other models and techniques that scientists use to train the algorithm. It is usually based off groups/sets of labeled data that the algorithm must use to then sort, classify, and label new incoming data. The concept of already labeled data as a model for an algorithm to aid in it’s learning is known as “supervised learning” (Stryker & Kavlakogu). Deep Learning is the next “doll” in the series and this enables “unsupervised learning”, or in other words, it doesn’t require the algorithm to have prelabeled groups of data to refer to for it’s predictions. Instead, Deep Learning utilizes “Deep Neural Networks” that mimic the more nuanced facets of a human being’s brain’s decision-making process. Generative AI of today combines all the previous elements and adds to it with something called a “foundational model” (Stryker & Kavlakogu). This foundational model typically presents itself in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM). These LLMs rely on extraordinary amounts of various data to train an unsupervised Deep Learning algorithm in order to create unique and original representations (videos, pictures, text) garnered from a prompt (Stryker & Kavlakogu).</p>
